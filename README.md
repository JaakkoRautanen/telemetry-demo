# Streaming Telemetry Demo Lab

Purpose of this lab is to demonstrate capabilities of Streaming Telemetry. 

In this lab there is a small network of Nokia SR Linux switches (because they are publicly available for lab use). Switches send continous stream of telemetry data to [gnmic](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/) which is gnmi collector. gnmic pushes data to InfluxDB. Grafana queries data from InfluxDB and visualizes it to dashboards.

> Note: This lab is greatly inspired by [Nokia SR Linux Streaming Telemetry Lab](https://github.com/srl-labs/srl-telemetry-lab) and uses their images for clients and devcontainer. Network part is mostly copied from there. Automation stack sligtly differs.

This lab can be run completely on Github Codespaces:

1. Click [Run In Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/JaakkoRautanen/telemetry-demo?quickstart=1)
2. Start containerlab by typing ```sudo clab deploy``` to terminal which opened in VScode inside browser

## Stopping lab

Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to open command palette in VScode and select `Codespaces: Stop codespace`. After that lab is stopped and doesn't consume your Codespaces quota.
